            <h1>What is TigerHacks?</h1>
            <p>
                TigerHacks is a hackathon based in Washington, D.C. that is organized
                by students from Jackson-Reed High School (formerly Woodrow Wilson High
                School). Our mission is to provide an inclusive and innovative platform
                for participants to develop their skills and create solutions for
                real-world problems. Our hackathon promotes creativity, collaboration,
                and innovation in the technology industry by bringing together students and
                professionals to develop innovative solutions to real-world problems.

                        <p>
                            Participants are challenged with a super-secret theme or problem
                            introduced at the beginning of the event and given a limited amount
                            of time to develop a project that addresses the challenge. Our hackathon
                            concludes with participants presenting their projects to a panel of judges.
                            This provides an opportunity for participants to showcase their work, receive
                            feedback, and compete for prizes.

                        <h3>Isn't hacking illegal?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Hackathons are not illegal because they are not really hacking in the
                            traditional sense. Hackathons are events where people come together
                            to collaborate and create new software projects, often within a limited
                            time frame. While the term "hackathon" may suggest that illegal activities
                            are taking place, in reality, these events are usually focused on developing
                            innovative solutions to real-world problems.

                            Our hackathon is free for all student attendees, and we will provide food
                            and snacks throughout the event. If you have any dietary restrictions, please
                            inform us on your registration form, and we will be happy to accommodate
                            any dietary requirements that you may have.

                            you with learning new concepts, languages, and other skills. Whether
                            you're an experienced programmer or just starting out, we welcome participants

                            Regrettably, we will not be able to offer an overnight hackathon this
                            year. However, we are exploring the possibility of providing overnight
                            accommodations in future events. We appreciate your understanding and
                            hope that you will still be able to join us for a fun and productive
                            hackathon experience.
